# About & Contributing

## Site Origins

This site was created to supplement the [Sierra Nevada Trails, Conditions, and Passes](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1578540459102320/) Facebook group. Discussion groups are a great resource for finding what is happening, or has happened recently, but they aren't great for longer structured data - a lot of the same questions came up regularly, useful information was shared then lost, etc.

Information is categorized into pages that you can navigate between in the sidebar to the left, you can jump around to a specific section of a page using the sidebar to the right, and there's a nice search bar up top. :)

This is site is built with the [DOCC](https://docc-theme.netlify.app/) starter/theme of [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/).
