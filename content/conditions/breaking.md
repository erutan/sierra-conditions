# 2021 Specific Info

## Conditions

You can keep an eye on historical snow levels at ca.gov's [Snow Water Equivalents](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/snowapp/sweq.action) page, which gives you a good high level overview of where snow levels are at historically. Useful in the winter/spring to try and figure out when summer in the alpine will start. For more detailed sources, check out the [snow page of this site](../snow/).

## Covid related changes

Yosemite's [Covid-19 page](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/covid19.htm) states they will still have a quota for day use similar to 2020 (but generall more permissive) and [backpacking permits are more convenient](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/covid19.htm#onthisPage-2).

SEKI is [tentatively planning to go back to walk-up permits](https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/wilderness_permits.htm): "At this time, we are also planning to resume in-person, “walk-up” permit issuance for the 2021 quota season. This means that a limited number of first-come, first-served permits will be available daily at select permit issuing stations in Cedar Grove, Grant Grove, Lodgepole, the Foothills, and Mineral King. Because of the pandemic, we are working on safety measures to make this possible while protecting visitor and employee health. Walk up permit availability will be subject to possible change if pandemic conditions necessitate to ensure visitor and staff safety. 

Nattional forest units seem to be going with the same 2 weeks out release of the 40% allocation of walk up permits on recreation.gov every Monday like in 2020.
