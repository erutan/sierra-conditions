## Backcountry "Walk Up" Permits

tl;dr - the previous 40% quota for walk-up backcountry permits for the High Sierra outside of SEKI are now released on recreation.gov either 3 (Humboldt Toiyobe), 7 (Yosemite), or 14 (Inyo & Sierra NF) days in advance at 7am Pacific. Inyo & Humboldt Toiyobe are the only jurisdictions that allow you to print out your own permit, you still have to pick it up at a ranger station by 10am the day of (or call for a late pick-up) for the rest.

[Yosemite](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wpres.htm)'s walk up permits are now renamed to "Week-Ahead Reservations". They can be reserved from 7 to 3 days in advance and are released at 7 am PDT. "Any unreserved permits will be available in person at wilderness centers only on the start date of the trip. Few, if any, unused permits will be available on any given day. Any unreserved permits will be available in person at wilderness centers only on the start date of the trip. Few, if any, unused permits will be available on any given day."

Note that there's no option to print your own permit, "the trip leader or alternate must pick up the wilderness permit in person at a wilderness center one day in advance (8 am to 5 pm) or on the same day (8 am to 11 am, unless held on Recreation.gov for a late arrival up to 5 pm)."

[SEKI](https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/wilderness_permits.htm) still has walk-up permits.

"Walk-up permits can be obtained starting from 1:00pm the day before your trip begins. Permits are only issued during hours of operation by trailhead rangers who provide important area information. You must arrive at the correct trailhead desk for the trailhead you are hoping to obtain a walk up permit for. Bring your entire party to the orientation. You will pay the fee of $15 per permit plus $5 per person at the issuing station. Credit cards are the preferred payment method. Trailhead rangers will not be able to make change for transactions. 

On your desired entrance date, once all of the quota for walk up permits is taken, a list will be started for permits that become available if a reserved party does not show up by the 10:00 am deadline. These no-show permits will become available for first-come first-serve walk ups. If you need to pick up your permit later than 10:00 am on the morning of your entry date, simply notify the Wilderness Office by calling 559-565-3766 and leave a message including your permit number and name."

[Inyo NF](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/inyo/passes-permits/recreation/?cid=fsbdev3_003808) is the same as 2021, releasing their 40% walkup quota 14 days in advance at 7 am PDT on recreation.gov.

"If you see a W displayed it means additional space will be added for short term reservations two weeks before the trip. at 7am Pacific time.  Example: you would look on the recreation.gov website at 7am Pacific Time on the same day of the week, two weeks before your trip entry date.

60% of the quota space can be reserved starting 6 months in advance.
40% of quota traditionally set aside for walk up permits is being added to the reservation website every day, 2 weeks before the trip.
If quota space is available, reservations can be made until one day before the trip.
Canceled space is returned to the reservation calendar at a random time within 24 hours."

[Sierra NF](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/sierra/passes-permits/?cid=fsbdev7_018115) is the same as Inyo, except you have to pick up your permit at a ranger station by 10am (unless you've contacted them for a late pick-up).

"Reservations will become available in a rolling window six months up to 14 days in advance of entry dates, if quota space is available, reservations can be made until one day before the trip [...] 40% of  the trailhead quota traditionally is set aside for walk up permits is being added to the reservation website and updated with each reservation."

[Humbolt Toiyobe](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/htnf/passes-permits/?cid=fseprd673368) releases their 50% quota 3 days in advance on recreation.gov, which is more in the spirit of a "walk up" permit. You can print them out yourself like Inyo.

"Visit Recreation.gov to make a reservation under “Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest – Wilderness Permits." Of each daily quota for a trailhead, 50 percent can be reserved ahead of time six months in advance of the desired entry date. The remaining 50 percent is available within three days of the date of entry." 

Emigrant still doesn't have a quota for backcountry permits.
