# 2021 Specific Info

## Conditions

You can keep an eye on historical snow levels at ca.gov's [Snow Water Equivalents](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/snowapp/sweq.action) page, which gives you a good high level overview of where snow levels are at historically. Useful in the winter/spring to try and figure out when summer in the alpine will start.

## Permits

The 60% of reservable backcountry permits on recreation.gov permits sold out in hours - it's unsure if we'll go back to normal walk-up permits or if it'll be a similar release the 40% of permits for two weeks out every Monday mid-dayish as in 2020. Hopefully COVID vaccinations keep at a good pace and offices will be open ~July.
