# 2021 Specific Info

## Conditions

You can keep an eye on historical snow levels at ca.gov's [Snow Water Equivalents](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/snowapp/sweq.action) page, which gives you a good high level overview of where snow levels are at historically. Useful in the winter/spring to try and figure out when summer in the alpine will start. For more detailed sources, check out the snow page.

## Permits

The 60% of reservable backcountry permits on recreation.gov permits sold out in hours - it's unsure if we'll go back to normal walk-up permits or if it'll be a similar release the 40% of permits for two weeks out every Monday mid-dayish as in 2020. Hopefully COVID vaccinations keep at a good pace and offices will be open ~July.

SEKI is [tentatively planning to go back to walk-up permits](https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/wilderness_permits.htm): "At this time, we are also planning to resume in-person, “walk-up” permit issuance for the 2021 quota season. This means that a limited number of first-come, first-served permits will be available daily at select permit issuing stations in Cedar Grove, Grant Grove, Lodgepole, the Foothills, and Mineral King. Because of the pandemic, we are working on safety measures to make this possible while protecting visitor and employee health. Walk up permit availability will be subject to possible change if pandemic conditions necessitate to ensure visitor and staff safety. 

Yosemite is [leaning towards keeping the 2020 system at the moment](http://highsierratopix.com/community/viewtopic.php?p=163295#p163295). National Forest jurisdictions are unknown.

FWIW, there's a [petition on change.org](https://www.change.org/p/chief-vicki-christiansen-changing-walk-in-permits-system-back-to-pre-covid-system?recruiter=1180856820&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=share_petition&utm_term=share_petition) to go back to normal walk-up permits in 2021. At the end of the day it will come down to percieved safety of rangers and the public, but it can't hurt to let it be known people prefer the old way of doing things (assuming you do, that is).
