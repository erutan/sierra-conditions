# 2022 Specific Info

## Fire Restrictions

## Backcountry Permits & Quotas

tl;dr - all walk-up Backcountry Permits for the High Sierra outside of SEKI are now on rec.gov released either 3, 7, or 14 days in advance.

Yosemite's [walk up permits are now renamed to "Week-Ahead Reservations"](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wpres.htm).  and operate similarly to Inyo in 2021 except they're 7 days out vs 14

"For the 2022 season, the remaining 40% of trailhead quotas will be released on a first-come, first-served basis on Recreation.gov seven days in advance at 7 am PDT. Popular trailheads will fill very quickly; be logged on and ready to reserve promptly at 7 am PDT seven days in advance of your desired start date. The latest you can make a reservation is three days before a trip (although, few reservations will be available at that point)."

SEKI [still has walk-up permits](https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/wilderness_permits.htm).

"Walk-up permits can be obtained starting from 1:00pm the day before your trip begins. Permits are only issued during hours of operation by trailhead rangers who provide important area information. You must arrive at the correct trailhead desk for the trailhead you are hoping to obtain a walk up permit for. Bring your entire party to the orientation. You will pay the fee of $15 per permit plus $5 per person at the issuing station. Credit cards are the preferred payment method. Trailhead rangers will not be able to make change for transactions. 

On your desired entrance date, once all of the quota for walk up permits is taken, a list will be started for permits that become available if a reserved party does not show up by the 10:00 am deadline. These no-show permits will become available for first-come first-serve walk ups."

[Inyo NF](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/inyo/passes-permits/recreation/?cid=fsbdev3_003808) is the same as 2021.

"If you see a W displayed it means additional space will be added for short term reservations two weeks before the trip. at 7am Pacific time.  Example: you would look on the recreation.gov website at 7am Pacific Time on the same day of the week, two weeks before your trip entry date.

60% of the quota space can be reserved starting 6 months in advance.
40% of quota traditionally set aside for walk up permits is being added to the reservation website every day, 2 weeks before the trip.
If quota space is available, reservations can be made until one day before the trip.
Canceled space is returned to the reservation calendar at a random time within 24 hours."

[Sierra NF](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/sierra/passes-permits/?cid=fsbdev7_018115) now require rec.gov and operates similarly to Inyo 2021.

"reservations will become available in a rolling window six months up to 14 days in advance of entry dates, if quota space is available, reservations can be made until one day before the trip [...] 40% of  the trailhead quota traditionally is set aside for walk up permits is being added to the reservation website and updated with each reservation."

[Humbolt Toiyobe](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/htnf/passes-permits/?cid=fseprd673368) has a similar 3 day window for walk permits (yay), but is now using rec.gov as well. It's unclear if you can still get quota permits from the ranger stations.

"Visit Recreation.gov to make a reservation under “Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest – Wilderness Permits." Of each daily quota for a trailhead, 50 percent can be reserved ahead of time six months in advance of the desired entry date. The remaining 50 percent is available within three days of the date of entry." 

Emigrant still doesn't have a quota for backcountry permits.
