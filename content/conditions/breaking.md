# 2020 Specific Info

## Covid 19 Backcountry Permits

Note: permits aren't going to go back into the pool like they normally do. If someone completes their orientation call and the permit is issued electronically, it doesn't matter if they a) never show up b) don't pick it up from the ranger station if it's printed there and left outside. Normally the permit is considered "issued" after someone comes to station in person to pick it up.

The [wilderness permits topic on HST](http://www.highsierratopix.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=14947&start=140) is worth checking.

### Yosemite Backpacking

No more walk up permits this year - sixty percent of reservations are available 24 weeks in advance; the remaining 40 percent are available two weeks in advance. Their [wilderness permit page](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wpres.htm) has the information you'll need if calling / mailing in a request, and a link to their [online reservation system](https://yosemite.org/yosemite-wilderness-permit-request-form/).

"Walk-up wilderness permits are not available in the park in 2020. Beginning June 11, 40% of permits that would normally be available first-come, first-served are instead available by lottery two weeks in advance. Beginning June 11, you can submit a request 15 days in advance of a hike, with the lottery running 14 days in advance. Unreserved permits remain available up to nine days in advance. It is not possible to obtain a wilderness permit reservation fewer than nine days in advance."

### Yosemite day use / driving on 120

"You have to go to log into recreation.gov and click the day entry permit thing for yosemite. Then it brings you to entering 1 vehicle, and a calendar. I did email them because their calendar has a glitch right now... if it says not yet released, it means there are no available permits on that day (even though it has the A for available). You just have to find a date that has permits.

You have to enter on the date the permit is reserved and it's good for 6 days.
Another option is the 2 days before an "A" day on the calendar, you can try to get a last minute permit." (from the group)

If you are driving through the park "you still need a day-use reservation. Tioga Road, which connects with Highway 120 at the park boundaries near Big Oak Flat and Tioga Pass, is not and has never been a state highway. Originally a private mining road, private citizens purchased the road and donated it to the National Park Service, which has improved and maintained the road ever since. The National Park Service is solely responsible for providing road maintenance, as well as law enforcement and emergency services, along all roads within Yosemite National Park." (via [Yosemite](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/covid19.htm?fbclid=IwAR1GlDCyRLpzhhTpSqSWESx_G8DsuFuidnRRoxGa-h1VtGh73O7AQ6t4FhE))

### SEKI

It's unclear how SEKI is handling their reserve of walk-in permits, but you can find out information on [reserving permits from their website](https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/wilderness_permits.htm). It's a bit of a process.

### Inyo NF

From [FB Conditions Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1578540459102320/permalink/2641571529465869/):

The current protocol for Inyo NF permits, which they don't quite spell out well on the website, is (1) Reserve on [Recreation.gov](https://www.recreation.gov/permits/233262?q=Inyo%20National%20Forest%20-%20Wilderness%20Permits), (2) Call Bishop USFS 760-873-2483 or Mammoth Lakes Welcome Center 760-924-5500 weekdays within a week of your trip, provide  and leave a voicemail with info below (3) Ranger will email you the actual permit to print out.

update from the group: "I spoke to someone at the Mammoth Lakes Welcome Center in regards to confirming my overnight permit for next week. She let me know that they are no longer answering phone calls, instead they are going through the voicemail (in order of receiving them). In your voicemail be sure to include your permit number, confirming you will be going, and leave a phone number for call back. They may call you back to confirm backpacking rules / guidelines, but if you mention you’ve gone over the rules already with a ranger (on your voicemail), they may not even call you back and will send the permit over via email. She said it’s taking about a day or so to get the voicemails, so be sure to call a few days before your overnight trip" I imagine they look at your registration history available through recreation.gov and don't just rely on what people say. :)

Walk up permits are released every Monday, for the following Monday through Sunday.

### Sierra NF, High Sierra District

from the group 

"Sign at Prather office June 2. Phone Extension 3300 goes to the person in charge of permits. They leave the permits in the box by the door. My understanding is they are only doing same or next-day “walk-in” permits at this time. Worked for me, but some people have reported difficulty getting through on the phone."

from their website:

"Wilderness Permits are still available by reservation or first come first served opportunities. For more information on how you can obtain a wilderness permit, please follow this link Wilderness Permits. Or to speak with a Forest Representative please call:

Ansel Adams Wilderness :

Bass Lake Ranger District Office at 559-877-2218 ex. 0

John Muir, Kaiser, Dinkey Lakes, and Ansel Adams Wilderness :

High Sierra Ranger District Office at 559-855-5355 ex. 0"

### Desolation Wilderness

Permits are available via [recreation.gov](https://www.recreation.gov/permits/233261) and are fairly normal aside from the fact that "Digital permits will be temporarily accepted during COVID-19" (note that's the permit pdf, not the confirmation email).

### Stanislaus National Forest

"June 11, 2020: FREE permits are required for overnight visits to the wilderness areas.

To reduce the spread of COVID-19, the Stanislaus National Forest has updated the process for obtaining overnight wilderness permits. NOTE: All visitors are responsible for knowing and abiding by all current regulations, including campfire prohibitions in place for the 2020 summer season. Read the current campfire restrictions and regulations in the Forest Order here. NO CAMPFIRES ARE PERMITTED in Wilderness."

The [Inyo Public Works News](https://www.inyocounty.us/residents/info-center/inyo-county-news-feed?dept=27) will list all updates - as now it's 30 minute delays with certain areas closed for parking. At some point with two weeks notice they're will shut down the trailhead parking lot.

## Covid 19 Front Country 

Campgrounds both public and private are opening up / should be open.

The Troutfitter has [some good information](https://thetroutfitter.com/fish-report) on general eastside Covid conditions. Not the most legible photo, but [here's a list of open campgrounds as of 6/2](https://thetroutfitter.com/assets/content/images/FishReport/CustomerImages/91840.jpg).
