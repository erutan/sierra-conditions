# Time Sensitive Updates

## Covid 19 Backcountry Permits

Note: permits aren't going to go back into the pool like they normally do. If someone completes their orientation call and the permit is issued electronically, it doesn't matter if they a) never show up b) don't pick it up from the ranger station if it's printed there and left outside. Normally the permit is considered "issued" after someone comes to station in person to pick it up.

### Yosemite

No more walk up permits this year.

Yosemite - sixty percent of reservations are available 24 weeks in advance; the remaining 40 percent are available two weeks in advance. Their [wilderness permit page](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wpres.htm) has the information you'll need if calling / mailing in a request, and a link to their [online reservation system](https://yosemite.org/yosemite-wilderness-permit-request-form/).

"Walk-up wilderness permits are not available in the park in 2020. Beginning June 11, 40% of permits that would normally be available first-come, first-served are instead available by lottery two weeks in advance. Beginning June 11, you can submit a request 15 days in advance of a hike, with the lottery running 14 days in advance. Unreserved permits remain available up to nine days in advance. It is not possible to obtain a wilderness permit reservation fewer than nine days in advance."

### SEKI

It's unclear how SEKI is handling their reserve of walk-in permits, but you can find out information on [reserving permits from their website](https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/wilderness_permits.htm). It's a bit of a process.

### Inyo NF

From [FB Conditions Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1578540459102320/permalink/2641571529465869/):

The current protocol for Inyo NF permits, which they don't quite spell out well on the website, is (1) Reserve on [Recreation.gov](https://www.recreation.gov/permits/233262?q=Inyo%20National%20Forest%20-%20Wilderness%20Permits), (2) Call Bishop USFS 760-873-2483 or Mammoth Lakes Welcome Center 760-924-5500 weekdays within a week of your trip, provide reservation #, and talk to a ranger, (3) Ranger will email you the actual permit to print out.

Walk up permits are released every Monday, for the following Monday through Sunday.

### Sierra NF, High Sierra District

"Sign at Prather office June 2. Phone Extension 3300 goes to the person in charge of permits. They leave the permits in the box by the door. My understanding is they are only doing same or next-day “walk-in” permits at this time. Worked for me, but some people have reported difficulty getting through on the phone."

### Stanislaus National Forest

"June 11, 2020: FREE permits are required for overnight visits to the wilderness areas.

To reduce the spread of COVID-19, the Stanislaus National Forest has updated the process for obtaining overnight wilderness permits. NOTE: All visitors are responsible for knowing and abiding by all current regulations, including campfire prohibitions in place for the 2020 summer season. Read the current campfire restrictions and regulations in the Forest Order here. NO CAMPFIRES ARE PERMITTED in Wilderness."

## South Lake Road Construction

The [Inyo Public Works News](https://www.inyocounty.us/residents/info-center/inyo-county-news-feed?dept=27) will list all updates - as now it's 30 minute delays with certain areas closed for parking. At some point with two weeks notice they're will shut down the trailhead parking lot.

## Covid 19 Front Country 

Private campgrounds are allowed to open, and short term lodging is open aside from in Mammoth Lakes, which are scheduled to open up in mid-late June.

The Troutfitter has [some good information](https://thetroutfitter.com/fish-report) on general eastside Covid conditions. Not the most legible photo, but [here's a list of open campgrounds as of 6/2](https://thetroutfitter.com/assets/content/images/FishReport/CustomerImages/91840.jpg).
