# Wildfires & Smoke

[Cal Fire Incidents](https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/) has information on all known wildfires in California, and is a good place to check if you notice smoke. Information on fires can be updated a few times a day.

Depending on jursidction fires may also show up on Inciweb you can use either their [map view](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/) or their [
Table of Incidents](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/accessible-view/).

[Wildland Fires & Smoke](https://wildlandfiresmoke.net/) has a lot of useful information about both fires and air quality.
