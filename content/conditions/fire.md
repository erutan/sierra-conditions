# Wildfires & Smoke

## Wildfires

[Cal Fire Incidents](https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/) has information on all known wildfires in California, and is a good place to check if you notice smoke. Information on fires can be updated a few times a day. You can also check their [map layout](https://www.fire.ca.gov/imapdata/index.html) for a more visual approach.

Depending on jursidction fires may also show up on Inciweb you can use either their [map view](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/) or their [Table of Incidents](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/accessible-view/).

[Wildland Fires & Smoke](https://wildlandfiresmoke.net/) has a lot of useful information about both fires and air quality.

Gaia GPS has layers for [satellite heat detection and current wildfires](https://blog.gaiagps.com/find-and-avoid-wildfires-with-new-heat-detection-layer/) for free users on both their web and mobile apps. [Caltopo](https://caltopo.com) has corresponding map overlays for free users as well: [fire activity and GOES 17 live fire detection](https://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=37.63354,-119.23153&z=11&b=mbt&o=mbt%2Cr&n=1,0.21&a=modis_vp%2Cgoesfire).

## Smoke & Air Quality Levels

https://www.windy.com/33.450/-112.080?37.296,-118.781,8

[AirNow Fire & Smoke Map](https://fire.airnow.gov/?lat=37.661622799999996&lng=-119.8005027&zoom=10#) you can now get the high quality (but slower updating) AirNow sensors combined with Purple Air's lower quality but faster updating ones in a single map!

[Purple Air's Map](https://www.purpleair.com/map?opt=1/mAQI/a10/cC0#8.02/37.519/-118.825) still has more sensors than the combined version above.

[NASA's Worldview](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?v=-122.31118585489266,33.45679500585166,-115.98306085489266,39.60619096789932&l=Reference_Labels,Reference_Features(hidden),Coastlines,MODIS_Aqua_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),MODIS_Terra_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor&lg=false&t=2015-08-24-T00%3A00%3A00Z) and [BlueSky Daily Runs](https://tools.airfire.org/websky/v2/run/standard/DRI4km-CMAQ/2020082100/#viewer) are great visual tools to show how smoke spread recently.

[San Joaquin Valley Air Piollution Control District](https://www.valleyair.org/Home.htm) covers some of the southern Sierra and surrounding areas.

[California Smoke Information](http://californiasmokeinfo.blogspot.com/) is an outreach point that multiple CA agencies use.

[Windy](https://www.windy.com/-PM2-5-pm2p5?cams,pm2p5,37.810,-119.221,8) has wind & air quality predictions. The further out they are, the less useful they are, and fires can create and alter their own patterns, but it's useful.

## Historical burn areas

Caltopo allows free / anonymous members to check historical burn layers with their [fire history map layer](https://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=37.52906,-119.04819&z=11&b=mbt&o=mbt%2Cr&n=1,0.21&a=fire).

If you're a premium member of Gaia you can use their [historical wildfire layer](https://blog.gaiagps.com/view-areas-affected-us-wildfire-gaia-gps-image-httpsgaiagps-quip-com-blobbyxaaanbuhc-9cifqlxchgppfzpymhdwq/) to see where past fires have been.
