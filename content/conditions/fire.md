# Wildfires & Smoke

## Wildfire Information

[Watch Duty](https://app.watchduty.org) is a non-profit site that provides a map that aggregates fire information from multiple jurisdictions.

Sometimes smaller fires don't show up on watchduty. [Cal Fire Incidents](https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/) ([map layout](https://www.fire.ca.gov/imapdata/index.html)) has information on fires managed by California. If the fire is being managed federally it will show up on Inciweb, check their [map view](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/) or their [Table of Incidents](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/accessible-view/).

[Wildland Fires & Smoke](https://wildlandfiresmoke.net/) has a lot of useful information about both fires and air quality.

Gaia GPS has layers for [satellite heat detection and current wildfires](https://blog.gaiagps.com/find-and-avoid-wildfires-with-new-heat-detection-layer/) for free users on both their web and mobile apps. 

[Caltopo](https://caltopo.com) has corresponding map overlays for free users as well: [fire activity and GOES 17 live fire detection](https://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=37.63354,-119.23153&z=11&b=mbt&o=mbt%2Cr&n=1,0.21&a=modis_vp%2Cgoesfire).

## Webcams

[AlertCalifornia](https://ops.alertcalifornia.org/cameras) by UC San Diego has hundreds of webcams around the state, and their angle of view will even be highlighted on a map when selected! You can zoom in and scroll around the map and the previews along the side will automatically be filtered, giving a great at a glance view of visibility in a region.

[Yosemite](https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/photosmultimedia/webcams.htm) and [SEKI](https://www.nps.gov/seki/learn/photosmultimedia/webcams.htm) have a collection of webcams that show areas of their park, some of which have hourly screenshots you can skim.  The SEKI page has a lot of dead links to outside sources as of summer 2024.

[Mammoth Mountain](https://www.mammothmountain.com/on-the-mountain/mammoth-webcam/the-summit) has a lot of realtime/live webcams because they're fancy.  There's a list of eastside webcams on the [Mono County](https://www.monocounty.org/plan-your-trip/weather-and-road-conditions/webcams-in-mono-county/) webpage too.

The Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District has a lot of webcams for [Owens Valley](https://www.gbuapcd.org/cgi-bin/cameraViewer).  Bishopweather has a webcam pointed towards [Mt. Humphreys, Basin Mountain, and Mt. Tom from Bishop, CA](http://bishopweather.com).

[Whitney](http://www.mountwhitneyforum.com/webcam/camera1.jpg)Portal has a zoomed in webcam aimed at a peak. Guess which?

## Current AQI & Smoke Monitoring

[AirNow Fire & Smoke Map](https://fire.airnow.gov/#8.47/37.1933/-119.1372)) you can now get the high quality (but slower updating) AirNow sensors combined with Purple Air's lower quality but faster updating ones in a single map! [Purple Air's Map](https://www.purpleair.com/map?opt=1/mAQI/a10/cC0#8.02/37.519/-118.825) still has more sensors than the combined version above. While limited to non-wilderness, you can click on a sensor and get a weeks worth of hourly readings to see data from the past 

[Google Maps Air Quality Layer](https://www.google.com/maps/@37.5069579,-118.702057,9.24z/data=!5m1!1e9?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) can lag behind on data inputs and includes a lot of extrapolation (skim their [support page for details](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/11270845?hl=en) if you care) but it's a useful high level attempt to merge a lot of data sources and come up with a detailed yet easy to glance at display.

[NASA's Worldview](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?v=-122.31118585489266,33.45679500585166,-115.98306085489266,39.60619096789932&l=Reference_Labels,Reference_Features(hidden),Coastlines,MODIS_Aqua_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),MODIS_Terra_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor&lg=false&t=2015-08-24-T00%3A00%3A00Z) is a great visual tool to see how smoke spread recently.

## Smoke & AQI Forecasts

[BlueSky Daily Runs](https://tools.airfire.org/websky/v2/run/standard/CANSAC-1.33km/2025090200?) shows a detailed 3 day forecast of smoke.  You can clearly see where it is expected to settle into basins and valleys etc. :)

[Windy](https://www.windy.com/-PM2-5-pm2p5?cams,pm2p5,37.810,-119.221,8) has wind & air quality predictions 3 days out. The further out they are, the less useful they are, and fires can create and alter their own patterns, but it's at least a good general idea of what to expect. You can get a longer view out on [just wind patterns](https://www.windy.com/?37.571,-118.714,9). If you open the detailed forecast bottom panel there's a floating button above it for webcams in vincinity which can be useful.

[AirNow Interactive Air Map Quality](https://gispub.epa.gov/airnow/?showgreencontours=false&xmin=-13621001.76694406&xmax=-12851128.018055802&ymin=4111418.553497082&ymax=4766331.01184444&monitors=ozonepm) gives you nice rounded (projected) shapes for different AQI levels as well as the official AirNow high quality sensors, and you can see models for the current and next day.

[NOAA's HRRR Models](https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/HRRRsmoke/) provide the backbone for most smoke forecasting models. Every 6 hours they do an extended model run that goes out for 3 days, so the 12Z run has the full matrix filled out. Surface Smoke & Vertically Integrated are probably the most useful.  There's a similar but prettier [Weather.gov Experimental Smoke Forecast](https://www.weather.gov/mtr/ExperimentalSmokeForecast) includes a 24 hour prediction of smoke coverage.

## Local Agencies

[Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District](https://www.gbuapcd.org/) covers Inyo & Mono.

[San Joaquin Valley Air Piollution Control District](https://www.valleyair.org/Home.htm) covers some of the southern Sierra and surrounding areas.

[California Smoke Information](http://californiasmokeinfo.blogspot.com/) is an outreach point that multiple CA agencies use.

## Historical burn areas

Caltopo allows free / anonymous members to check historical burn layers with their [fire history map layer](https://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=37.52906,-119.04819&z=11&b=mbt&o=mbt%2Cr&n=1,0.21&a=fire).

If you're a premium member of Gaia you can use their [historical wildfire layer](https://blog.gaiagps.com/view-areas-affected-us-wildfire-gaia-gps-image-httpsgaiagps-quip-com-blobbyxaaanbuhc-9cifqlxchgppfzpymhdwq/) to see where past fires have been.
