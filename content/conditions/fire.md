# Wildfires & Smoke

## Wildfires

[Cal Fire Incidents](https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/) has information on all known wildfires in California, and is a good place to check if you notice smoke. Information on fires can be updated a few times a day.

Depending on jursidction fires may also show up on Inciweb you can use either their [map view](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/) or their [Table of Incidents](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/accessible-view/).

[Wildland Fires & Smoke](https://wildlandfiresmoke.net/) has a lot of useful information about both fires and air quality.

## Smoke & Air Quality Levels

[AirNow Fire & Smoke Map](https://fire.airnow.gov/?lat=44.50506000000007&lng=-73.48001999999997&zoom=12) you can now get the high quality (but slower updating) AirNow sensors combined with Purple Air's lower quality but faster updating ones in a single map!

[BlueSky Daily Runs](https://tools.airfire.org/websky/v2/run/standard/DRI4km-CMAQ/2020082100/#viewer) is a great visual tool to show how smoke spread recently.

[San Joaquin Valley Air Piollution Control District](https://www.valleyair.org/Home.htm) covers some of the southern Sierra and surrounding areas.
