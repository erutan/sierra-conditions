# Wildfires & Smoke

## Wildfires

[Cal Fire Incidents](https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/) has information on all known wildfires in California, and is a good place to check if you notice smoke. Information on fires can be updated a few times a day. You can also check their [map layout](https://www.fire.ca.gov/imapdata/index.html) for a more visual approach.

Depending on jursidction fires may also show up on Inciweb you can use either their [map view](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/) or their [Table of Incidents](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/accessible-view/).

[Wildland Fires & Smoke](https://wildlandfiresmoke.net/) has a lot of useful information about both fires and air quality.

## Smoke & Air Quality Levels

[AirNow Fire & Smoke Map](https://fire.airnow.gov/?lat=44.50506000000007&lng=-73.48001999999997&zoom=12) you can now get the high quality (but slower updating) AirNow sensors combined with Purple Air's lower quality but faster updating ones in a single map!

[NASA's Worldview](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?v=-122.31118585489266,33.45679500585166,-115.98306085489266,39.60619096789932&l=Reference_Labels,Reference_Features(hidden),Coastlines,MODIS_Aqua_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),MODIS_Terra_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor&lg=false&t=2015-08-24-T00%3A00%3A00Z) and [BlueSky Daily Runs](https://tools.airfire.org/websky/v2/run/standard/DRI4km-CMAQ/2020082100/#viewer) are great visual tools to show how smoke spread recently.

[San Joaquin Valley Air Piollution Control District](https://www.valleyair.org/Home.htm) covers some of the southern Sierra and surrounding areas.

[California Smoke Information](http://californiasmokeinfo.blogspot.com/) is an outreach point that multiple CA agencies use.
