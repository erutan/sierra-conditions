# Wildfires & Smoke

[Cal Fire Incidents](https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/) has information on all known wildfires in California, and is a good place to check if you notice smoke. Information on fires can be updated a few times a day.

Depending on jursidction fires may also show up on Inciweb you can use either their [map view](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/) or their [
Table of Incidents](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/accessible-view/).

## Smoke & Air Quality Levels

[Air Pollution in California: Real-time Air Quality Index Visual Map](https://aqicn.org/map/california/) has mostly coastal data, but is useful at a glance.

[Air Now](https://cfpub.epa.gov/airnow/index.cfm?action=airnow.local_state&stateid=5&mapcenter=0&tabs=0) a slightly different user interface, but still mostly geared to urban areas - both a more graphical layering on the state map as well as textual breakouts of individual monitoring stations.
