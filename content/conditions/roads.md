# Road Closures

## Caltrans Road Conditions 

This information is very accurate, and updated often. 

### By Highway 

If you know the highway you're looking for (120, 108, 88, etc) enter it on the [road information page](https://roads.dot.ca.gov/roadscell.php).

### Visually via Interactive Map

From webcams to closures to traffic, there's a lot of information available at the [Caltrans Quickmap](http://quickmap.dot.ca.gov/) - under 'options' webcams and message signs are often very useful, as well as all of the road conditions.

## Yosemite

Longer term conditions and changes are listed [on their Current Conditions page](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/conditions.htm). There is a separate page for [Tioga and Glacier Point Roads Plowing Updates](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/tioga.htm).

For more up to date information call 209/372-0200 (press 1 then 1) for a pre-recordded message of the most up-to-date conditions.

## SEKI

Longer term conditions and changes are listed [on their Current Conditions page](https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/conditions.htm). They also have a specific [road construction page](https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/road-construction.htm)

## Minor roads

It's often best to check with [local papers and sources](http://localhost:8081/resources/local/) for updates to roads to trailheads etc - it's important news for small mountain towns!

[Inyo Public Works News](https://www.inyocounty.us/residents/info-center/inyo-county-news-feed?dept=27) would cover all road construction in Inyo County.
