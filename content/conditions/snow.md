# Snow Levels

## Broad Overviews

* [CDEC Snow Pack Conditions Page](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/snowapp/sweq.action) gives you a simple high level overview of where snow levels are compared to averages. Useful in the winter/spring to try and figure out when the alpine will be easily accessible. You can also see [snow levels from the current year plotted against a few others of note](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/reportapp/javareports?name=PLOT_SWC) for even more context. The "Central" snowpack area in the links above is roughly from Yosemite to Tahoe, and "Southern" would be around Mammoth to south of Whitney in the foothills of the Kern watershed.  In terms of what is generally considered the High Sierra "Southern" is of the most interest.
* The [NWS Climate Prediction Center](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/90day/) can be handy for trying to guess the impacts of the above.  For example in 2025 it leans a bit warm and dry for the Sierra for the spring, which means that the slightly below average snow levels wouldn't expect to get a big boost in May or June, and should melt out faster than usual.  This is obviously forecasting far into the future and is rather soft, but if you had to pick which month to reserve a permit etc...
* The [Forest Service snow depth tool](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd1045012.html) is low enough resolution that it can easily underestimate snow levels if it samples rock outcroppings, tree cover, etc. It's should be taken with a few grains of salt, along with the mapping applications that import this layer. Similarly the NOAA's [regional snow analyses for the Sierra Nevada](https://www.nohrsc.noaa.gov/nsa/index.html?units=e&region=Sierras) has a lot of high level snow and water information in graphical form, though it's better used to understand trends or an overview vs details about a specific location.

## Recent Sentinel 2 Satellite Imagery

There's a number of ways to view medium-high resolution satellite imagery that is generally 4-6 days old:

* [Copernicus Browser](https://browser.dataspace.copernicus.eu/?zoom=10&lat=37.3887&lng=-119.03248&themeId=DEFAULT-THEME&visualizationUrl=U2FsdGVkX19mL%2BpmxXk0WVEN3PDm3P7chI2nAlrihax50%2FcpnXDGfXBg4OZFWTWxL3fHPmASzIoT6wPByOGblzCJEdHanDpy477pkzCOk0G8z7IbebE3ssDcyN2%2FlzYS&datasetId=S2_L2A_CDAS&fromTime=2024-08-20T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&toTime=2024-08-20T23%3A59%3A59.999Z&layerId=1_TRUE_COLOR&demSource3D=%22MAPZEN%22&cloudCoverage=30&dateMode=SINGLE) is a very powerful free service. Basically use the search field up top go to the area you want, then in the hamburger menu check contours (and water bodies if there is a LOT of snow) to have more of an idea of what you're looking at. By default it will load the latest Sentinel 2 imagery for your area, you can move between dates, filter for maximum cloud cover, or choose different layers or . The ability to load scans from past years is very useful if you've done a route before - I was able to load early September 2017 (when I went over some passes holding snow) and compare it to July 2024 and saw conditions were currently slightly simpler than before!
* [EO Browser](https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser/?zoom=13&lat=37.71513&lng=-119.18449#search) is a free service from Sentinel Hub. They have a tutorial that explains the UI, it is a similar process to the Copernicus Browser above.
* [Caltopo](https://caltopo.com/) has Sentinel 2 data integrated with their $50/year plan, which is covered in this [blog post](https://blog.caltopo.com/2023/01/12/winter-travel-series-4-learning-about-current-and-forecasted-conditions/) by them.  This is handy for getting an idea if it overlays a specific trail etc vs the area it's in as you have access to CalTopo's map layers which have a lot more detail than Copernicus & EO Browser's basic topo.
* **GaiaGPS** has a map layer called "[FreshSat](https://blog.gaiagps.com/view-recent-conditions-with-fresh-sat-maps/)" which tries to mix the best of Sentinel 2 and Landsat data. While this is theoretically better than the above, there may be some contrast and alignment issues as layers are blended. It's available for all users on the web, and on the mobile app with a Gaia GPS premium membership. Their cloud detection is less sophisticated, it's often out of date, and you can't go back to previous scans... but it's a different option if you're already paying for Gaia.

## (Eastern) Sierra Avalanche Center

[ESAC](https://esavalanche.org/)'s [observations page with trip reports](https://esavalanche.org/ObservationsPage) page with trip reports covers the region from Lee vining down to Bishop, and [SAC](https://www.sierraavalanchecenter.org/) ([observations page with trip reports](https://www.sierraavalanchecenter.org/observations) covers the area between Ebbetts and Yuba. The forecasts pages on both are also worth checking, as well as general information regarding avalanche safety. [Avalanche.org](https://avalanche.org/) shows all forecsat areas in the US.

##  Monitoring station data

Individual monitoring stations give much more specific (and accurate) data than satellite but high altitude ones can not be reporting (and there aren't a ton to begin with), and low altitude ones are usually irrelevant. YMMV. Anything recent is "provisional" data which hasn't been analyzed or adjusted/normalized and may have anamolies.

The most useful real time sensor map I've found is the [NOAA Weather & Hazards Data Viewer](https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?&zoom=5&scroll_zoom=false&center=40,-97&boundaries=false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false&tab=observation&hazard=true&hazard_type=all&hazard_opacity=70&obs=true&obs_type=weather&elements=temp,wind,gust&temp_filter=-80,130&gust_filter=0,150&rh_filter=0,100&elev_filter=-300,14000&precip_filter=0.01,18&obs_popup=true&obs_density=60&obs_provider=ALL). Different stations are capable of transmitting different data, by default you'll usually see the current temp in black and windspeed in red, and maybe a graphic for wind direction. Clicking on a specific station gets you data from the past three days.  You can play with the overlay filters to say show all [precip in the last 24h](https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?&zoom=5&scroll_zoom=false&center=40,-97&boundaries=false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false&tab=observation&hazard=true&hazard_type=all&hazard_opacity=70&obs=true&obs_type=weather&elements=temp,wind,gust&temp_filter=-80,130&gust_filter=0,150&rh_filter=0,100&elev_filter=-300,14000&precip_filter=0.01,18&obs_popup=true&obs_density=60&obs_provider=ALL) (or another interval between 1h and 72h).

The [National Water and Climate Center's interactive map](https://nwcc-apps.sc.egov.usda.gov/imap/#version=169&elements=&networks=!&states=!&basins=!&hucs=&minElevation=&maxElevation=&elementSelectType=any&activeOnly=true&activeForecastPointsOnly=false&hucLabels=false&hucIdLabels=false&hucParameterLabels=true&stationLabels=&overlays=&hucOverlays=&basinOpacity=75&basinNoDataOpacity=25&basemapOpacity=100&maskOpacity=0&mode=data&openSections=dataElement,parameter,date,basin,options,elements,location,networks&controlsOpen=true&popup=&popupMulti=&popupBasin=&base=esriNgwm&displayType=basinstation&basinType=6&dataElement=WTEQ&depth=-8&parameter=PCTMED&frequency=DAILY&duration=I&customDuration=&dayPart=E&monthPart=E&forecastPubDay=1&forecastExceedance=50&useMixedPast=true&seqColor=1&divColor=7&scaleType=D&scaleMin=&scaleMax=&referencePeriodType=POR&referenceBegin=1991&referenceEnd=2020&minimumYears=20&hucAssociations=true&relativeDate=-1&lat=42.875&lon=-112.010&zoom=5.5) shows data from monitoring stations across the Sierra Nevada, which is a nice mix of color coded basin averages and specific sensors. You can also get a [listing of the stations](https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/reportGenerator/view/customMultipleStationReport/daily/state=%22CA%22%20AND%20network=%22SNTLT%22,%22SNTL%22%20AND%20element=%22SNWD%22%20AND%20outServiceDate=%222100-01-01%22%7cname/0,0/name,stationId,WTEQ::value,WTEQ::delta,SNWD::value,SNWD::delta?fitToScreen=false) in California. 

You can also check out the [California Data Exchange Center](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/snow/current/snow/) for individual snow levels in various locations. You can also search for individual sensors by [river basin](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/getAll?sens_num=3) or check a list of [active snow sensors](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/misc/SnowDepth.html). They publish bulletins on [the second week of February, March, April, and May](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/snow/bulletin120/index2.html#) containing forecasts of the volume of seasonal runoff from the state's major watersheds, and summaries of precipitation, snowpack, reservoir storage, and runoff in various regions of the State.

Gaia GPS premium members can get [snowtel overlays showing recent changes](https://blog.gaiagps.com/find-fresh-snow-with-the-new-snow-stations-daily-map/) when they have an active internet connection.

## Other resources

[GISsurfer](https://mappingsupport.com/p2/gissurfer-interactive-recreation-disaster-maps.html) is a little janky, but allows you to play around with a ton of GIS layers including snow and water.

For water levels, as opposed to snow, [Dreamflows](https://www.dreamflows.com/flows.php?zone=canv&page=real&form=norm&mark=All) has gathered up stream flow sensors in California & Nevada and done a good job of providing at a glance comments on it to put the data in context. Mostly lower elevation larger rivers or reservoir related, but could be useful.
