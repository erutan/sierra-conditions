# Trip Reports

In order to have a sidebar visible on the side of the page (like on this one for example) or on mobile devices as an off-canvas navigation, you are required to do some global configuration, as well as some configuration per markdown file.

## Global Configuration
Open the `gridsome.config.js`. The configuration for the sidebar is located under `settings > sidebar`.
