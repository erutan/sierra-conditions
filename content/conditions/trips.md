# Trip Reports

## Sierra Nevada Trip Reports & Current Conditions

Yes, Facebook does have a search function, but trying to find old trip reports for XC passes isn't quite the easiest. 

The lack of archival ease of use is balanced out by the lack of friction from using a social media network vs writing up blog / forum posts, there tends to be a lot of brief up to date posts from people [Sierra Nevada Trip Reports & Current Conditions](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sierratripreports) and it's a good place to get a feel for what conditions currently are as well as ask questions.

Please do use the search functionality first - if you ask about an area someone posted a trip report of yesterday, it just clutters up the feed.

## High Sierra Topix

A [classic message board](http://www.highsierratopix.com/) with a lot of information buried in old threads. If you want a little bit more info than what Secor has for a cross country pass or are interested in a basin this is a good place to start. There's yearly [conditions threads](https://www.highsierratopix.com/community/viewforum.php?f=34), though the community is more focused on traditional narrative trip reports & armchair backpacking.

## Alltrails

A lot of people write up little summaries of their hikes, usefulness can vary greatly but it's heavily used and [searching for a trail or peak](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/us/california/shaver-lake?b_tl_lat=38.11596693694656&b_tl_lng=-119.60239556029401&b_br_lat=36.4380746924341&b_br_lng=-118.11834087585135) can be surprisingly useful.

## Other Facebook Groups

If you are doing something very popular (or something that shares a pass or two), there are dedicated [PCT](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PCNST/), [JMT](https://www.facebook.com/groups/JohnMuirTrail/) & the [JMT NoBo Info Hub](https://www.facebook.com/groups/JMT.NOBO/), [Rae Lakes loop](https://www.facebook.com/groups/496524253873881/), [SEKI High Sierra Trail](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HighSierraTrail/), [Whitney](https://www.facebook.com/groups/30962451768/), [Tahoe Rim Trail](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1452516735060978/) etc groups that should have very good information on those specific areas. Many often have yearly groups as well, which are probably more informative and less navel-gazey nostalgia. There's a few general Sierra Nevada groups that will have trip reports, but there tends to be a lot of noise to signal. [Eastern Sierra Hiking & Backpacking](https://www.facebook.com/groups/easternsierrahiking) is one of the more informative ones.

For the PCT there's a number of vloggers that post updates to Instagram & Youtube, so searching on those platforms to check for passes early season can work out as well.

## Ranger Stations

Backcountry rangers file reports of trails they've been on and also get beta from hikers that have reported back after a trip. Calling a wilderness center and getting beta can be very useful.

Yosemite updates their [Wilderness Conditions](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wildcond.htm) page with information gathered from backcountry rangers on a somewhat regular basis. SEKI has a similar [Trail Conditions](https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/trailcond.htm) page.

Note: Rangers tend to err slightly on the side of caution when describing how dangerous conditions are... it's a hassle for them when people are lost / injured / die, so don't hold it against them! The more touristy / popular an area is, the more information will tend to be padded.

## Climbing resources

Another good source for XC trip reporting is  [climber.org's reports section](https://www.climber.org/reports/). The interface is a bit dated, and there's often more technical XC beta included in trip reports than backpackers will find useful, but a lot of interesting terrain is on the way to a peak somewhere.

[Summitpost](https://www.summitpost.org/) is also geared more towards climbers & mountaineers vs backpackers and hikers, but as with climber.org there's overlap and looking up a peak can be a great starting point in planning.

The Sierra Club [SPS Trip Reports](https://www.sierraclub.org/angeles/sierra-peaks/trip-reports) have a lot of peak based entries.

[Bob Burd's](https://www.snwburd.com/bob/) personal site is very peak focused, but included detailed information on approaches that you could extrapolate from.
