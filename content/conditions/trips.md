# Trip Reports

## Sierra Nevada Trails, Conditions, and Passes Facebook Group

Yes, Facebook does have a search function, but trying to find old trip reports for XC passes isn't quite the easiest. 

The lack of archival ease of use is balanced out by the lack of friction from using a social media network vs writing up blog / forum posts, there tends to be a lot of brief up to date posts from people [Sierra Nevada Trails, Conditions, and Passes](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1578540459102320/) and it's a good place to get a feel for what conditions currently are as well as ask questions.

Please do use the search functionality first - if you ask about an area someone posted a trip report of yesterday, it just clutters up the feed.

## High Sierra Topix

A [classic message board](http://www.highsierratopix.com/) with a lot of good beta on it. If you want a little bit more info than what Secor has for a cross country pass (or just whether some unnamed area is doable), this is a good place to run a search. There's also some posts for current mosquito conditions etc.

## Summitpost

[Summitpost](https://www.summitpost.org/)eared more towards climbers & mountaineers vs backpackers, but a lot of cross country (XC) routes will cover terrain climbers will take to a peak.

## Climber.org

Another good source for XC trip reporting is  [climber.org's reports section](https://www.climber.org/reports/).

## Other Facebook Groups

If you are doing something very popular (or something that shares a pass or two), there are dedicated PCT, JMT, Rae Lakes, SEKI High Sierra Trail, Whitney Portal, etc groups that should have very good information. There's also general Sierra hiking/backpacking groups that will have trip reports not in Trails, Conditions, and Passes, but there tends to be a lot of signal to noise.

For the PCT there's a number of vloggers that post updates to Instagram & Youtube, so searching on those platforms early season can work out as well.

## Ranger Stations

Backcountry rangers file reports of trails they've been on and also get beta from hikers that have reported back after a trip. Calling a wilderness center and getting beta can be very useful.

Inyo is working on a trail conditions report for internal use, and may share that with the public - since we can no longer go into a ranger station and ask about previous trips that'd be another useful source of information.

Note: Rangers tend to err slightly on the side of caution when describing how dangerous conditions are... it's a hassle for them when people are lost / injured / die, so don't hold it against them! The more touristy / popular an area is, the more information will tend to be padded.
