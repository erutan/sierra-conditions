# Trip Reports

## Sierra Nevada Trip Reports & Current Conditions

Yes, Facebook does have a search function, but trying to find old trip reports for XC passes isn't quite the easiest. 

The lack of archival ease of use is balanced out by the lack of friction from using a social media network vs writing up blog / forum posts, there tends to be a lot of brief up to date posts from people [Sierra Nevada Trip Reports & Current Conditions](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1578540459102320/) and it's a good place to get a feel for what conditions currently are as well as ask questions.

Please do use the search functionality first - if you ask about an area someone posted a trip report of yesterday, it just clutters up the feed.

## High Sierra Topix

A [classic message board](http://www.highsierratopix.com/) with a lot of good beta on it. If you want a little bit more info than what Secor has for a cross country pass (or just whether some unnamed area is doable), this is a good place to run a search. There's also some posts for current mosquito conditions, annual trip report threads, etc.

## Climbing resources

Another good source for XC trip reporting is  [climber.org's reports section](https://www.climber.org/reports/). The interface is a bit dated, and there's often more technical XC beta included in trip reports than backpackers will find useful, but a lot of interesting terrain is on the way to a peak somewhere.

[Summitpost](https://www.summitpost.org/) is also geared more towards climbers & mountaineers vs backpackers and hikers, but as with climber.org there's overlap and looking up a peak can be a great starting point in planning.

## Other Facebook Groups

If you are doing something very popular (or something that shares a pass or two), there are dedicated [PCT](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PCNST/), [JMT](https://www.facebook.com/groups/JohnMuirTrail/) & the [JMT NoBo Info Hub](https://www.facebook.com/groups/JMT.NOBO/), [Rae Lakes loop](https://www.facebook.com/groups/496524253873881/), [SEKI High Sierra Trail](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HighSierraTrail/), [Whitney](https://www.facebook.com/groups/30962451768/), [Tahoe Rim Trail](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1452516735060978/) etc groups that should have very good information on those specific areas. Many often have yearly groups as well, which are probably more informative and less navel-gazey nostalgia. There's a few general Sierra Nevada groups that will have trip reports, but there tends to be a lot of noise to signal. [Eastern Sierra Hiking & Backpacking](https://www.facebook.com/groups/easternsierrahiking) is one of the more informative ones.

For the PCT there's a number of vloggers that post updates to Instagram & Youtube, so searching on those platforms to check for passes early season can work out as well.

## Ranger Stations

Backcountry rangers file reports of trails they've been on and also get beta from hikers that have reported back after a trip. Calling a wilderness center and getting beta can be very useful.

Inyo is working on a trail conditions report for internal use, and may share that with the public - since we can no longer go into a ranger station and ask about previous trips that'd be another useful source of information.

Note: Rangers tend to err slightly on the side of caution when describing how dangerous conditions are... it's a hassle for them when people are lost / injured / die, so don't hold it against them! The more touristy / popular an area is, the more information will tend to be padded.

## Other resources

[Postholer google map overlay](https://www.postholer.com/gmap/gmap.php) lets you pull in a ton of info on PCT segments.
