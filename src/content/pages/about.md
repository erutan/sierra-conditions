## Site Origins

This site was created to supplement the [Sierra Nevada Conditions Reports & Current Conditions](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sierratripreports) Facebook group. Discussion groups are a great resource for finding what is happening, or has happened recently, but they aren't great for longer term structured data and resources.

Information is categorized into pages that you can navigate between in the sidebar to the left, you can jump around to a specific section of a page using the sidebar to the right, and there's a nice search bar up top. :)

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and styled with [PicoCSS](https://github.com/Yohn/PicoCSS), focusing on modern web standards and CSS variables for easy customization.

## Contributing

If you're familiar with markdown, feel free to [fork and submit a PR on Github](https://github.com/erutan/sierra-conditions/) if you find a typo or feel there's some valuable information missing.

If there's a more philosophical or structural concern, create an issue at the repo linked above, or leave a comment on the [Sierra Nevada Trip Reports & Current Conditions](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sierratripreports/) Facebook group.
