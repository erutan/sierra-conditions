## Site Origins

This site was created to supplement the [Sierra Nevada Conditions Reports & Current Conditions](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sierratripreports) Facebook group. Discussion groups are a great resource for finding what is happening, or has happened recently, but they aren't great for longer term structured data and resources.

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and styled with [PicoCSS](https://github.com/Yohn/PicoCSS).

## Contributing

If you're familiar with markdown, feel free to [fork and submit a PR on Github](https://github.com/erutan/sierra-conditions/) if you find a typo or feel there's some valuable information missing. If there's a more philosophical or structural concern, create an issue.
