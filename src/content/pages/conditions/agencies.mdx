## Backcountry Wilderness Permits

The traditional 40-50% of permits released six months in advance are relatively unchanged aside from Yosemite moving to a lottery system on recreation.gov and the traditional mailing and phone options removed.

**Important:** Permits that aren't marked with a late pickup and haven't been printed out on rec.gov will be released at 10am of the day they're for in Yosemite & Inyo (and probably Toiyabe & Sierra NF).

### Additional Notes

**SEKI Walk-ups:** Walk-up permits can be obtained starting from 1:00pm the day before your trip begins at the correct trailhead desk. Fee is $15 per permit plus $5 per person. If you need to pick up your permit later than 10:00am, call the Wilderness Office at 559-565-3766.

**Emigrant Wilderness:** Still doesn't have a quota for backcountry permits, despite getting pretty thrashed.
