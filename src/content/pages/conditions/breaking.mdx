# 2025 Specific Info

## Fire Restrictions

Note in most jurisdictions you need [free CA fire permit](https://www.readyforwildfire.org/permits/campfire-permit/) to use a backpacking stove.

[SEKI](https://home.nps.gov/seki/learn/nature/fire-restrictions.htm) fire restrictions page.

[Yosemite](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/firerestrictions.htm) fire restrictions page.

[Sierra NF Alerts & Conditions Page](https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/sierra/alerts-notices) skim this looking for fire notices.

[Inyo NF Alerts & Conditions Page](https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/inyo/alerts-notices) skim this looking for fire notices.

Flooding and related damage is more of a concern this year - there's links to various county, law enforcement, and land managers sources on the [Notices & News](/news) page and the [Roads](/roads) pages. It could also be useful to have resources to keep on top of [snow](/snow) levels.

## Road Restrictions

The road into Devil's Postpile (Red's & Agnes Meadows etc) is expected to be open [Thursday through Sunday until September 15th, then just weekends](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/inyo/alerts-notices/?cid=fseprd1127643) due to construction.

## Backcountry Wilderness Permits

The traditional 40-50% of permits released six months in advance are relatively unchanged aside from Yosemite moving to a lottery system on recreation.gov and the traditional mailing and phone options removed.

**Important:** Permits that aren't marked with a late pickup and haven't been printed out on rec.gov will be released at 10am of the day they're for in Yosemite & Inyo (and probably Toiyabe & Sierra NF).

### Additional Notes

**SEKI Walk-ups:** Walk-up permits can be obtained starting from 1:00pm the day before your trip begins at the correct trailhead desk. Fee is $15 per permit plus $5 per person. If you need to pick up your permit later than 10:00am, call the Wilderness Office at 559-565-3766.

**Emigrant Wilderness:** Still doesn't have a quota for backcountry permits, despite getting pretty thrashed.
