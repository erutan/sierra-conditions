## Additional Fire Resources

**Smaller fires:** Sometimes smaller fires don't show up on Watch Duty. Check [Cal Fire Incidents](https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/) ([map layout](https://www.fire.ca.gov/imapdata/index.html)) for California-managed fires. Federal fires appear on Inciweb - see their [map view](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/) or [Table of Incidents](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/accessible-view/).

**Mobile apps:** [Gaia GPS](https://blog.gaiagps.com/find-and-avoid-wildfires-with-new-heat-detection-layer/) and [Caltopo](https://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=37.63354,-119.23153&z=11&b=mbt&o=mbt%2Cr&n=1,0.21&a=modis_vp%2Cgoesfire) both have satellite heat detection and fire activity layers available for free users.

**General info:** [Wildland Fires & Smoke](https://wildlandfiresmoke.net/) has comprehensive information about both fires and air quality.

## Current AQI & Smoke Monitoring

[AirNow Fire & Smoke Map](https://fire.airnow.gov/#8.47/37.1933/-119.1372)) you can now get the high quality (but slower updating) AirNow sensors combined with Purple Air's lower quality but faster updating ones in a single map! [Purple Air's Map](https://www.purpleair.com/map?opt=1/mAQI/a10/cC0#8.02/37.519/-118.825) still has more sensors than the combined version above. While limited to non-wilderness, you can click on a sensor and get a week's worth of hourly readings to see data from the past. 

[Google Maps Air Quality Layer](https://www.google.com/maps/@37.5069579,-118.702057,9.24z/data=!5m1!1e9?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) can lag behind on data inputs and includes a lot of extrapolation (skim their [support page for details](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/11270845?hl=en) if you care) but it's a useful high level attempt to merge a lot of data sources and come up with a detailed yet easy to glance at display.

[NASA's Worldview](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?v=-122.31118585489266,33.45679500585166,-115.98306085489266,39.60619096789932&l=Reference_Labels,Reference_Features(hidden),Coastlines,MODIS_Aqua_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),MODIS_Terra_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor&lg=false&t=2015-08-24-T00%3A00%3A00Z) is a great visual tool to see how smoke spread recently.

## Smoke & AQI Forecasts

[BlueSky Daily Runs](https://tools.airfire.org/websky/v2/run/standard/CANSAC-1.33km/2025090200?) shows a detailed 3 day forecast of smoke.  You can clearly see where it is expected to settle into basins and valleys etc. :)

[Windy](https://www.windy.com/-PM2-5-pm2p5?cams,pm2p5,37.810,-119.221,8) has wind & air quality predictions 3 days out. The further out they are, the less useful they are, and fires can create and alter their own patterns, but it's at least a good general idea of what to expect. You can get a longer view out on [just wind patterns](https://www.windy.com/?37.571,-118.714,9). If you open the detailed forecast bottom panel there's a floating button above it for webcams in vicinity which can be useful.

[AirNow Interactive Air Map Quality](https://gispub.epa.gov/airnow/?showgreencontours=false&xmin=-13621001.76694406&xmax=-12851128.018055802&ymin=4111418.553497082&ymax=4766331.01184444&monitors=ozonepm) gives you nice rounded (projected) shapes for different AQI levels as well as the official AirNow high quality sensors, and you can see models for the current and next day.

[Pivotal Weather](https://www.pivotalweather.com/model.php?m=hrrr&p=smoke_sfc&fh=loop&r=us_sw) is a better UI for [NOAA's HRRR Models](https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/HRRRsmoke/) which provide the backbone for most smoke forecasting models. Every six hours HRRR does a 48 hour forecast so choose the most recent 00z, 06z, 12z, or 18z run from select list in the top left. There's a similar but prettier [Weather.gov Experimental Smoke Forecast](https://www.weather.gov/mtr/ExperimentalSmokeForecast) that includes a 24 hour prediction of smoke coverage.

## Lightning Strike Detection

You can look up HRRR's lightning strike detection on [Pivotal Weather](https://www.pivotalweather.com/model.php?m=hrrr&p=lgtden&fh=loop&r=us_sw).

[Lightning Maps](https://www.lightningmaps.org/#m=oss;t=3;s=0;o=0;b=0.00;ts=0;ts24=1;z=9;y=37.277;x=-118.5096;d=2;dl=2;dc=0;src=6;) is community run and can be a little janky, but is fun to have open in the frontcountry when you hear thunder and wonder where it hit.

## Local Agencies

[Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District](https://www.gbuapcd.org/) covers Inyo & Mono.

[San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District](https://www.valleyair.org/Home.htm) covers some of the southern Sierra and surrounding areas.

[California Smoke Information](http://californiasmokeinfo.blogspot.com/) is an outreach point that multiple CA agencies use.

## Historical burn areas

Caltopo allows free / anonymous members to check historical burn layers with their [fire history map layer](https://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=37.52906,-119.04819&z=11&b=mbt&o=mbt%2Cr&n=1,0.21&a=fire).

If you're a premium member of Gaia you can use their [historical wildfire layer](https://blog.gaiagps.com/view-areas-affected-us-wildfire-gaia-gps-image-httpsgaiagps-quip-com-blobbyxaaanbuhc-9cifqlxchgppfzpymhdwq/) to see where past fires have been.
