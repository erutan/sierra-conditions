## Additional Fire Resources

**Smaller fires:** Sometimes smaller fires don't show up on Watch Duty. Check [Cal Fire Incidents](https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/) ([map layout](https://www.fire.ca.gov/imapdata/index.html)) for California-managed fires. Federal fires appear on Inciweb - see their [map view](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/) or [Table of Incidents](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/accessible-view/).

**Mobile apps:** [Gaia GPS](https://blog.gaiagps.com/find-and-avoid-wildfires-with-new-heat-detection-layer/) and [Caltopo](https://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=37.63354,-119.23153&z=11&b=mbt&o=mbt%2Cr&n=1,0.21&a=modis_vp%2Cgoesfire) both have satellite heat detection and fire activity layers available for free users.

**General info:** [Wildland Fires & Smoke](https://wildlandfiresmoke.net/) has comprehensive information about both fires and air quality.

## Lightning Strike Detection

You can look up HRRR's lightning strike detection on [Pivotal Weather](https://www.pivotalweather.com/model.php?m=hrrr&p=lgtden&fh=loop&r=us_sw).

[Lightning Maps](https://www.lightningmaps.org/#m=oss;t=3;s=0;o=0;b=0.00;ts=0;ts24=1;z=9;y=37.277;x=-118.5096;d=2;dl=2;dc=0;src=6;) is community run and can be a little janky, but is fun to have open in the frontcountry when you hear thunder and wonder where it hit.

## Local Agencies

[Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District](https://www.gbuapcd.org/) covers Inyo & Mono.

[San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District](https://www.valleyair.org/Home.htm) covers some of the southern Sierra and surrounding areas.

[California Smoke Information](http://californiasmokeinfo.blogspot.com/) is an outreach point that multiple CA agencies use.

## Historical burn areas

Caltopo allows free / anonymous members to check historical burn layers with their [fire history map layer](https://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=37.52906,-119.04819&z=11&b=mbt&o=mbt%2Cr&n=1,0.21&a=fire).

If you're a premium member of Gaia you can use their [historical wildfire layer](https://blog.gaiagps.com/view-areas-affected-us-wildfire-gaia-gps-image-httpsgaiagps-quip-com-blobbyxaaanbuhc-9cifqlxchgppfzpymhdwq/) to see where past fires have been.
