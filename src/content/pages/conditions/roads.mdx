## Caltrans Road Conditions 

This information is very accurate and updated often.  If you know the highway you're looking for (120, 108, 88, etc) enter it on the [road information page](https://roads.dot.ca.gov/roadscell.php). From webcams to closures to traffic, there's a lot of information available at the [Caltrans Quickmap](http://quickmap.dot.ca.gov/) - under 'options' webcams, and message signs are often very useful, as well as all of the road conditions.

Caltrans has a dedicated page for [mountain passes](https://dot.ca.gov/caltrans-near-me/district-10/district-10-popular-links/mountain-passes) they maintain - Ebbetts Pass (State Route 4), Monitor Pass (State Route 89), and Sonora Pass (State Route 120).

The social media accounts for District 9 [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Caltrans9) or [TwitterX](https://twitter.com/Caltrans9) will post major announcements.

## Yosemite

Longer term conditions and changes are listed [on their Current Conditions page](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/conditions.htm). There is a separate page for [Tioga and Glacier Point Roads Plowing Updates](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/tioga.htm) that aims for weekly updates.  If you're wondering when Tioga will open, NPS states "**predicting when these roads will open is not possible, even in late spring**, because weather in April and May can affect plowing progress significantly". That said looking at [historical opening dates](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/seasonal.htm) for years with a similar April 1st snowpack will give you a decent guess.

For more up to date information call 209/372-0200 (press 1 then 1) for a pre-recorded message of the most up-to-date conditions.

## Mammoth & Devil's Postpile

The [Devil's Postpile Alerts & Conditions](https://www.nps.gov/depo/planyourvisit/conditions.htm) page shows when the road down into Devil's Postpile (Agnew & Red's meadow) has opened historically as well as it's current status.

For the lakes road into town (access to Duck Pass & Mammoth Pass trailheads) check the [visitmammoth](https://www.visitmammoth.com/blogs/activity-road-updates/) tourism site. Note that there's year round parking around Tamarack Lodge, but walking the road up from there can add 2-3 miles to your trailhead each way.

## SEKI

Longer term conditions and changes are listed [on their Current Conditions page](https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/conditions.htm). They also have a specific [road construction page](https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/road-construction.htm)

## Eastern Sierra County Resources

[Inyo County Public Works](https://www.inyocounty.us/services/public-works/news/inyo-county-road-openclosed-status) [see PDF at the bottom of page] & [Mono County Public Works](https://www.monocounty.ca.gov/roads/page/county-road-closures) update information **daily** including expected opening dates and open/closed status for trailhead access roads along the Eastern Sierra.  

Inyo NF has a new [current conditions](https://www.fs.usda.gov/r05/inyo/conditions) page that collects information from ranger districts and links to county resources. :)

This is great information for any trailhead access that isn't a highway!

For a complete directory of agencies and their contact information, see the [Agency Info](/conditions/agencies) page.

## Minor roads

It's often best to check with [local papers and sources](/resources/local/) for updates on roads to trailheads, etc - it's important news for small mountain towns!

Looking for county sheriff's departments social media pages can be useful as well - any unplanned road closures will generally be described on them.

Local police & sheriff's departments often have fast updates on minor roads:
